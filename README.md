# ArtSpaceApp
This is the ArtSpaceApp project assignment solution from the Android Basics with Compose course. 
The ArtSpaceApp is an android app with more than one art images(10 in this case) that can be displayed on the screen.
When the app is launched, an art image is displayed on the screen. 
The app has a previous and next buttons to display the previous or next art image.
When you click the previous button and there is no art image to display, a Toast message 
pops up to notify you that you can navigate back to see previous art images.
When you click the next button and there is no art image to display, a toast message will pop up to
notify the user that there are no more art image to display.
